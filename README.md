# gamebuino-hack
A diy clone of open source gamebuino classic (http://legacy.gamebuino.com/wiki)

<p><h1>Changes</h1>
<p>- Hack is based on Atmega328 PDIP so it does not have A6 and A7 (PC6 and PC7) pins
<p>- Button C is moved to D5 (PD5) -> rebuilding of all games and bootloader needed for this change to work
<p>- Battery sensor is moved to ADC3 (PC3) -> rebuilding of all games are needed for this change to work
<p>- No ambient light sensor
<p>- No pwm control for background led
