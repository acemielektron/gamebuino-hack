A diy clone of open source [gamebuino classic](http://legacy.gamebuino.com/wiki)

**Gamebuino games modified for hack**
  - None of these games are written by me, they belong to their respective authors
  - Games with open source are recompiled using arduino ide (v1.8.10) for hack
  - Recompiled B-RALLY (buino-rally) didn't work, so original hex file was disassembled and modified to work on hack.
